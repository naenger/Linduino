LTpowerPlay has the ability to generate lines of code that can be
inserted directly into a Linduino sketch and compiled. The sketch
template in this directory provides the framework for compiling this
generated code.

Simply insert the code from LTpowerPlay at the locations indicated by
comments and compile and run on a Linduino.
