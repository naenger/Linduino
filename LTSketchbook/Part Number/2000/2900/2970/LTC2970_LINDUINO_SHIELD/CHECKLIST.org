** QUESTIONS
*** should sense resistor be larger to sense finer than 25 mA steps (500uV/0.02)?
*** is Linduino pulling ALERTB? Why?
    - ALERTB is the IO pin
***  can we add a diode-OR to the power supply 
**** so that the 2970 can draw power from either the Linduino +5v or from the +12V plug?
**** of course, this might make no sense since this is a Linduino shield, and the LTC2970 is useless without the Linduino
*** need to figure-out how to tell the Linduino to program the EEPROM; this is for when the Linduino is a DC590 emulator
*** new servo resistor value for larger servo range? 
**** With 100k the whole range is +/-10% REVIEW
*** should the I2C bus pull-up to 3.3v instead of 5v?
    
    
** REVIEW
*** are all footprints correct?
*** feedback loop stable?
**** test with load pulse
*** transistors not over-voltage
**** LED drivers
*** input caps correct type and magnitude
*** output caps correct size and magnitude
*** board silk screen correct
**** DC number
**** LTC logo and phone number
**** turrets correctly labeled
**** jumpers correctly labeled
**** LEDs correctly labeled
     
* CODE ITEMS
** Linduino
*** butterworth filter is probably the best, not running average (memory footprint)
*** why 350ms delay? 
**** use a scope to trigget on the I2C command that initiates the IDAC change
**** measure settling time
**** is the 350ms mostly analog settling, or IDAC lag, or ADC loop?
***** ADC loop should take < 33.3ms for one register to update
*** write the loop so it toggles between HIGH and LOW current, taking measurements each toggle
**** this would eliminate half of the delay
** LTpowerPlay?
*** modified DC590 sketch
*** is there any way that LTPP can understand external temperature? -- probably not
** REVIEW
*** is all text clean (menus, reporting, messages,...)?
*** any missing features?
*** remove all useless commented code
*** all alerts and warnings in place
*** all alerts and warnings at correct voltage
*** change temperature algorithm to match latest code
* SPECS TO VERIFY/CHARACTERIZE
** voltage tolerance, no servo
*** resistor -induce error
*** other sources of voltage error?
** servo voltage range
*** high
*** low
*** servo precision (1-LSB step size)
*** servo accuracy 
**** INL
**** DNL
** current limitations
*** inductor
*** LTC3604
*** board
*** anything too hot at max current?
** output voltage waveform clean
*** light load
*** medium load
*** heavy load
** PGOOD function
*** as advertised
** LEDs
*** PGOOD
*** VDD_5V
*** GPIO_0
*** GPIO_1
