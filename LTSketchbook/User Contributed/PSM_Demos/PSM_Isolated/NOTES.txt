First wrote "data-sweep.ino" to collect efficiency curves. The user must
manually adjust the load current and press any key to run a set of
curves as the Linduino steps IBC voltage and measures efficiency. This
sketch prints CSV data to the serial terminal.

Next wrote "efficiency-search.ino" to use the same routines to sweep
the IBC voltage and search for the efficiency peak voltage, then set
it at the most efficient voltage. The user sets the load current and
triggrs the search. This sketch prints to the serial terminal.

efficiency-search-LCD.ino has the same idea but it uses an LCD screen
to display the search. This has two potential advandages. First there
is the self-contained aspect: not requiring any PC hook-up. Second is
the ability to run without power from the PC, which may or may not
make noise worse.

I needed to modify the libraries/LTC2945/LTC2945.cpp and
libraries/LTC2945/LTC2945.h, as well as (I think)
libraries/LT_PMBUS/LT_Wire.h to make averything talk nicely together
(PMBus and I2C parts). Also, the Adafruit RGB chield needed some
modifications to be able to play nicely on the I2C bus.
